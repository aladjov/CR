    "**📖 Understanding Feature-to-Data Ratios**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before creating new features, it's critical to understand how many features your data can reliably support. This analysis uses the **Events Per Variable (EPV)** principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "| EPV Level | Risk Level | Recommendations |\n",
    "|-----------|------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **EPV ≥ 20** | Low risk | Stable coefficients, reliable inference |\n",
    "| **EPV = 10-20** | Moderate | Standard practice, consider regularization |\n",
    "| **EPV = 5-10** | Elevated | Strong regularization required (L1/Lasso) |\n",
    "| **EPV < 5** | High risk | Reduce features or collect more data |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Assumptions:**\n",
    "1. **Minority class drives capacity**: For classification, the smaller class limits feature count\n",
    "2. **Correlated features are redundant**: Highly correlated features (r > 0.8) count as ~1 effective feature\n",
    "3. **Model type matters**: Tree models are more flexible than linear models\n",
    "4. **Regularization helps**: L1/L2 penalties allow more features with less data\n",

    "- Effective feature count after removing redundancy\n",

    "1. **Events Per Variable (EPV)** - Calculated the data's capacity to support features\n",
    "2. **Effective Features** - Identified redundant features due to high correlation\n",
    "3. **Model Complexity Guidance** - Determined appropriate model types based on data size\n",
    "4. **Segment Capacity** - Evaluated whether segmented modeling is viable\n",

    "### Feature Engineering\n",
    "5. **Automated Recommendations** - Framework suggested feature opportunities\n",
    "6. **Time-Based Features** - Created tenure, recency, active period metrics\n",
    "7. **Engagement Scores** - Built composite email engagement metrics\n",
    "8. **Customer Segments** - Created value-frequency and recency-based segments\n",
    "9. **Encoding Strategies** - Identified optimal encoding for each categorical\n",
