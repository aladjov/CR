Before introducing any changes to the codebase look in the existing code and look for the best place to introduce changes / enhancements to avoid duplication and overlapping scope.  Make sure that you ask questions instead of silently making architectural decisions. 

Follow test driven development practices with at least 90% coverage with meaningfull tests that cover edge cases and antipatterns. Create tests first using the specification then do the implementation.After completing all tasks do once again check against the specification. Make sure that all tests pass. Any bug we find should be covered by dedicated unit or integration test. What other similar diconnects / edge cases are possible - can we try to come up with more tests to cover them.     

Do not use comments but instead descriptive class methods fields name. Favor short single responsibility functions with no side effects which operate on the same abstract level. Start from public methods high level functions first then functions that are implementation details. Design the structure of the code in such a way to avoid code repetition and allow inheritance to take care of variations. Favour compact code with no ceremonial assignments (for variables used just once). Try to make everything testable and easy to read a code formatting request do not spread method arguments on many lines unless they are more than 5. In general prefer compact code that does not spread too many lines
